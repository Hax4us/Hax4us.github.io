Well as we know now github does not allow password based access from cli or terminal & that's why we have only two options left to push commits on github.
1. Use Personal Access Token as password.
2. Use SSH keys.

### Generate Token
---

* First open this [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) url in your favorite browser & click on **Generate New Token**.

* Write whatever you want in **Note** field then choose expiration of your token.

* Tick on **repo**

* Click on **Generate Token**.

* Now copy this token and paste in some secured place because then you will not be able to see this token again.

### Token In Action
---

* Now use it just like you were using your password before. Just paste your
  token in the place of password :)
